3) Get Maximum in Generated Array Leetcode Solution  The problem Get Maximum in Generated Array Leetcode Solution provided us with a single integer. With the given single integer, we need to find the maximum integer in the generated array. The array generation has some rules. Under the imposed constraints, we need to find the maximum integerthat could have been generated. 
The rules are: 
inputn = 7
output = 3
Explanation: According to the given rules:
nums[0] = 0, nums[1] = 1
nums[(1 * 2) = 2] = nums[1] = 1
nums[(1 * 2) + 1 = 3] = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 1 = 2
nums[(2 * 2) = 4] = nums[2] = 1
nums[(2 * 2) + 1 = 5] = nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 + 2 = 3
nums[(3 * 2) = 6] = nums[3] = 2
nums[(3 * 2) + 1 = 7] = nums[3] + nums[4] = 2 + 1 = 3
So, we can see nums = [0,1,1,2,1,3,2,3], and the maximum is 3 among them. Thus the answer is 3.
